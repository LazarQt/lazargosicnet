I'm a Software Developer with 10 years of experience. I primarily worked in <strong>.NET</strong> environments and used various web technologies and frameworks to further enhance the user experience whenever needed. 

Whenever I'm programming during my free time, it's to optimize my *other* hobbies by leaving heuristics behind and solving problems with a data-driven approach. Here are a [couple of examples](/projects).

This website is made with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), although I also have experience with more sophisticated frameworks such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
